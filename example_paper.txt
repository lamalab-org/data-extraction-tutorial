1. Introduction
Controlled radical polymerization methods enable the synthesis of
polymers with controlled molecular weight, architecture, end-group fi­
delity and dispersity.[1–10] For years, polymers exhibiting high
livingness were considered to intrinsically also possess low dispersity
values and vice versa following a common misconception that broad
molar mass distributions must be associated with increased side re­
actions. However, it has recently become evident that these two terms
should not be related and high dispersity polymers can also display very
high-end group fidelity.[11–14] Considering that both low and high
dispersity polymers can be advantageous for a wide range of applica­
tions[7,10,15–17] many groups have exploited engineering and chem­
istry approaches to control dispersity as well as the shape of molar mass
distributions.[12,18–28] Polymer blending, for example, is a traditional
way to control polymer dispersity by synthesizing a range of polymers
(e.g. 10–20 polymers) with different molecular weights and mixing
them.[23,29,30] Although this methodology usually results in bimodal
molar mass distributions, our group recently demonstrated that by
simply mixing two polymers (one of high Đ and one of low Đ), any in­
termediate dispersity value could be obtained with extremely high
precision.[31] In 2016, Fors and co-workers introduced an exciting
approach whereby the shape of the molar mass distributions could be
efficiently controlled by leveraging the temporal regulation of initiation.
[32,33] In particular, a syringe pump was utilized to gradually feed the
initiating species in an already ongoing controlled polymerization
resulting in shape-controlled distributions.[17,22,34,35] In an alterna­
tive strategy, Guironnet’s group subsequently employed a computer-
controlled tubular flow reactor providing a general route to designing
polymer molar mass distributions through flow chemistry.[36] Boyer
and co-workers also contributed to this direction by elegantly combining
flow-mediated polymerization approaches with mathematical models to
fully control the shape of molar mass distributions.[37–39]
Chemistry strategies have also been developed to control polymer

dispersity by manipulating important polymerization steps such as
initiation and/or deactivation.[11,12,24,40,41] Such methods offer
additional opportunities when compared to engineering alternatives as
they often result in fairly monomodal molar mass distributions, do not
require any specialized equipment (e.g. syringe pumps or specialized
software), and are quite simple to implement. For instance, Maty­
jaszewski and coworkers and our group independently regulated the
deactivation step in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) by
simply varying the copper or iron catalyst concentration yielding ho­
mopolymers with a wide range of dispersities and without compro­
mising their end-group fidelity.[42–46] As the ATRP methods are rather
limited in monomer scope[44,47], our group developed a straightfor­
ward batch reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT)
polymerization method to tailor polymer dispersity for a range of
monomer classes including (meth) acrylates, acrylamides and styrene as
well as methacrylic acid, methyl vinyl ketone and vinyl acetate. This was

achieved by mixing two RAFT agents with vastly different chain transfer
constants in various ratios.[24,25]
Several other chemistry approaches have also been developed
including Goto’s work in exploiting a small amount of a co-monomer
during reversible complexation-mediated polymerization[13] and
Chiu’s work on utilizing photochromic initiators in cationic polymeri­
zation.[14] One common limitation of many of the aforementioned
methodologies is the challenge of achieving dispersity control in block
copolymers and multiblock copolymers.[48–52] Our group was able to
circumvent this by recently reporting the synthesis of sequence-
controlled multiblocks with on-demand control over dispersity.[53]
The key to our approach was the regulation of the activity of the chain
transfer agent during RAFT polymerization. In particular, we leveraged
a switchable RAFT agent, also referred to as a universal RAFT agent
[54–56], allowing access to dispersity control in both homopolymers
and multiblock copolymers while also achieving near-quantitative
yields and very high livingness.[53] However, the effect of the organic
solvent and the degree of polymerization on the final dispersity has yet
to be investigated, limiting the scope of our approach (Fig. 1).
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Effect of increasing the organic content concentration
For the initial experiments, methyl 2-[methyl(4-pyridinyl) carba­
mothioylthio]propionate was used as the switchable RAFT agent,
dimethylacrylamide (DMA) as a model monomer, 2-2′-azobis[2-(2-imi­
dazoline-2-yl)propane] dichloride (VA-044) as the free radical initiator
and dimethylformamide (DMF) as the organic solvent. Although
depending on the organic content, a different amount of VA-044 is
required to achieve quantitative monomer conversion (Figure S1) (i.e.
the higher the water content the less free radical initiator is needed
[51,57]), we consistently employed 0.1 equivalents with respect to the
RAFT agent for all polymerizations to allow for a more meaningful
comparison. The targeted degree of polymerization (DP) was set at 200
and the monomer concentration was fixed at 20 v/v.
Under the aforementioned conditions, the first polymerization was
conducted in pure aqueous media and in the absence of added acid, (i.e.
sulphuric acid) a broad, yet monomodal, molar mass distribution (Mn =
23,400, Ɖ=1.58) was obtained with good agreement between theoret­
ical and experimental molecular weight (Fig. 2a). A near-quantitative
conversion was reached within 2 h as evident by 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and the chain transfer agent was fully
consumed according to the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) UV-
detector (Figure S2). Upon replicating the experiment, albeit with
0.25 equivalents of sulphuric acid, the dispersity was decreased to 1.52,
while further increases in the amount of added acid (0.5, 1 and 1.5
equivalents) led to gradually lower Ɖs (1.35, 1.20 and 1.16, respec­
tively, Fig. 2a, Table S1). It is noted that a slight excess of acid was
required to fully protonate the RAFT agent and reach the minimum Ɖ
value due to the presence of DMA which elevates the initial pH value to
approximately 9–10 (prior to the addition of acid).[55,58]
Switching from aqueous media to a mixture of [DMF]:[H2O] = 1:4
led to comparable data, although a higher excess of acid (i.e. 3 equiv­
alents) was required to attain the lowest possible Ɖ (Fig. 2b, Table S2).
Instead, when the polymerizations were performed in mixtures of
[DMF]:[H2O] = 1:1, a higher Ɖ (~1.70) could be obtained when the
deprotonated RAFT agent was utilized (Fig. 2c, Table S3). As such, a
broader Ɖ range was possible under these conditions (1.23–1.70), thus
highlighting an advantage of employing formulations with increased
organic content. However, when the DMF percentage was increased
further ([DMF]:[H2O] = 4:1), the lowest Ɖ that could be achieved was
1.31 (6 equivalents of acid) and no further decrease was possible
regardless of the amount of added acid (e.g. up to 12 equivalents,
Fig. 2d-f, Table S4). Nevertheless, by increasing the organic content we
pave the way for the potential control over the Ɖ of more hydrophobic
monomers, thus significantly expanding the scope of the developed
system. It is noted that for all the higher Ɖs attained, successful in-situ
chain-extension experiments were conducted, revealing that very high
livingness could be maintained (see section entitled effect of various

organic solvents).
2.2. Effect of targeting various degrees of polymerization
We were subsequently interested to study how the degree of poly­
merization (DP) would affect the Ɖ control. In a series of experiments,
we targeted polymers with a DP of 50, 100, 200 and 400.
The first reactions were conducted in organic/aqueous mixtures with
an increased organic content ([DMF]:[H2O] = 4:1) and the results are
summarized in Fig. 3. For DP = 50 and DP = 100 (Fig. 3a-b, Table S5-6),
Ɖ ranges of 1.15–1.56 and 1.19–1.68 were obtained, respectively, when
all polymerizations had reached very high monomer conversions. As can
be concluded from the previous section, when targeting DP = 200, the
minimum Ɖ achieved was 1.31 (Ɖ range is 1.31–1.76, Fig. 3c, Table S4).
However, for DP = 400 no satisfactorily control over Ɖ was possible. In
particular, even when 12 equivalents of acid were employed, the Ɖ
could not drop below 1.58, thus highlighting the limitations of the
system to control Ɖ at higher DPs (Fig. 3d, Table S7). This was attributed
to the nature of the solvent which does not allow for the sufficient
protonation of the RAFT agent.[59,60] To bypass this, we sought to
increase the monomer concentration from 20% v/v to 50% v/v and
indeed by minimizing the solvent content, a lower Ɖ could be achieved
when identical acid equivalents were employed (when using 6 equiva­
lents of acid the lowest Ɖ at 20% v/v was 1.31 and the value was further
decreased to 1.23 at 50% v/v monomer concentration, Figure S3a&c,
Table S4&S8). To fully circumvent this issue, we replicated the experi­
ments in aqueous media (at 20% v/v). Pleasingly, excellent Ɖ control
could be achieved not only for DP = 50 and DP = 100 but also for DP =
200, DP = 400 and DP = 800 (Figure S4, Tables S1&S10-13). More
specifically, the higher the DP, the wider the Ɖ range that could be
obtained while more equivalents of acid were required to achieve the
lowest possible Ɖ. In addition, when the RAFT agent was unprotonated,
[55,58,61] a higher Ɖ could be obtained for higher DPs. For instance, for
DP = 50 the Ɖ range was relatively narrow (1.14–1.49), and the lowest
Ɖ was obtained when 1 equivalent of sulphuric acid was utilized while
the unprotonated RAFT agent led to a Ɖ of 1.49. Instead, for DP = 800, a
broader Ɖ range was achieved (1.22–1.67), the lowest Ɖ was attained at
much higher acid concentrations (i.e. > 6 equivalents) and in the
absence of acid a much higher Ɖ was displayed (i.e. 1.67). It is therefore
apparent that much better control over Ɖ can be achieved in pure
aqueous media for various targeted DPs. It is also noted that in contrast
to DMF, when higher monomer concentrations were employed in water,
(e.g. 50% v/v instead of 20% v/v) slightly higher Ɖs were obtained
(Figure S3b&d, Table S9).
2.3. Effect of various organic solvents
Given the limitation of DMF to satisfactorily lower polymer Ɖ, a
range of alternative solvents were also explored. First, high Ð PDMA was
prepared (DP20) in a range of different solvents -such as H2O, DMF,
dimethylacetamide (DMAc), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile
(ACN) and dioxane- and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-ToF-MS) was performed to
investigate the chain end-group fidelity of the syntheses (Fig. 4d-f&S5d-
f). Pleasingly, in all cases, a single polymeric species was evidenced,
corresponding to CTA functionalized PDMA, albeit with Li+, Na+ and K+
adducts. This indicates that high end-group fidelity could be achieved
for all solvents, even when high dispersity values were targeted. We also
highlight that in these syntheses very low concentrations of free radical
initiator were utilized (<0.03 equivalents w.r.t RAFT agent), so these
peaks were not visible in the MALDI-ToF-MS.
We therefore selected these solvents, in turn, so to investigate the
effect of adding acid on the dispersity range obtainable in each medium
(Tables S14-19, Figure S5). In a similar fashion to DMF, DMAc failed to
yield very low Ɖ values, as even at 24 equivalents of acid the minimum Ɖ
achieved was 1.36 (Figure S5b, Table S14). It is also noted that when
these two solvents were employed, in combination with high acid con­
centrations (>2 equivalents), a side reaction could be detected via 1H
NMR whereby sulphuric acid reacted with the solvent thus leading to
solvent degradation (Figure S6-8). This side reaction and the chain
transfer to solvent constant of DMF could also be, partially, responsible
for the higher dispersities obtained.[62] However, it is worth

mentioning that despite the side reaction, very high livingness could be
maintained in both solvents as evident by successful in-situ chain
extension experiments (Figure S10, Table S19).
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was then selected as a solvent
(Figure S5c, Table S15). Although no side reaction was found in this
solvent, the lowest Ɖ achieved was 1.23 when 20 equivalents of sul­
phuric acid were employed. Nevertheless, a broad Ɖ range could be
targeted (1.23–1.79) thus revealing the potential of this solvent, espe­
cially considering that DMSO is a medium in which both hydrophilic and
relatively hydrophobic monomers are soluble.[63,64] Dioxane also
proved to be a suitable solvent for Ɖ control resulting in a broad Ɖ range
(1.17–1.86) while the lowest possible Ɖ was attained in the presence of 4
equivalents of acid (Figure S5a, Table S16). Perhaps the most promising
organic medium was ACN (Fig. 4b, Table S17) as in the presence of just 2
equivalents of acid a Ɖ of 1.19 could be obtained. The total range ach­
ieved was also relatively broad (1.19–1.66) therefore establishing ACN
as an excellent alternative to aqueous media. For a more meaningful
comparison with the other solvents, when 2 equivalents of acid were
used very high Ɖs were achieved for DMAc and DMF (1.66 and 1.55
respectively), while DMSO and dioxane led to much lower Ɖs (1.37 and
1.29 respectively). As such, it can be concluded that both ACN and water
are very successful in controlling the Ɖ of homopolymers at low acid
concentrations. Free radical polymerizations were also performed in
these solvents and the result shows the maximum achievable molar mass
obtained exceeded 200 kDa in all cases, which is higher than that of
high-dispersity polymers made in the presence of unprotonated RAFT
agent, confirming the polymerization is controlled under RAFT mecha­
nism (Figure S11 and Table S20). Indeed, it should be highlighted that in
pure ACN (rather than in 80:20 ACN: H2O) just 0.5 equivalents of acid
were required to obtain a final polymer with a dispersity as low as 1.25,
further exemplifying ACN as an effective alternative to water (Figure S9,
Table S18). These results show that in order to achieve similar dis­
persities, various amounts of acid were required to achieve the same
protonation degree of the RAFT agent in different solvents (Fig. 4a-c,
Figure S5a-c, Table S1, S4, S14-S17). To correlate the protonation state
of the switchable RAFT agent in different media (e.g., deuterated DMSO
and D2O), the chemical shift of pyrinidyl ring hydrogen of the RAFT
agent was characterized by 1H NMR spectra (Figure S12).[56] It is
shown that in deuterated DMSO higher equivalents of acid was needed
to protonate the RAFT agent than in D2O. Despite the high amounts of
acid added, the RAFT agent is stable in organic solvent (DMSO‑d6) while
a small amount (0.8%) of the ester bonds of the RAFT agent R group was
hydrolyzed (Figure S13-S15). Importantly, the Z-group of the RAFT
agent was not influenced by the acid and therefore the polymer living­
ness was not affected (Figure S17 & Table S24).
2.4. Synthesis of Ɖ–controlled diblock and triblock copolymers with
varying degrees of polymerization
After establishing optimal conditions to control Ɖ in homopolymers,
we were interested in assessing how the DP of the added second block
would affect the final Ɖ of the diblock. To study this, we first synthesized
three homopolymers at various DPs using the deprotonated RAFT agent
(i.e. DP 50, DP = 100, DP = 200). We then varied the amount of
monomer added for the second block (aiming for the second block to be
composed of either DP = 25, or DP = 50, or DP = 100 or DP = 200) while
utilizing an excess of acid which would enable the sufficient switch to a
fully protonated macroCTA (Fig. 5, Table S21). In particular, when
starting from a relatively low DP for the first block (DP = 50, initial Ɖ
~1.50), the in-situ addition of DP = 25 or DP = 50 already led to a
Fig. 5. The effect of the DP of the second block on the overall dispersity of diblock copolymers prepared by RAFT polymerization. In all cases the reactions were
performed in pure water, with the CTA unprotonated for the first block and fully protonated for the second block. The DP of the first block was varied between 50 and
200 and the DP of the second block was varied between 25 and 200. In all plots, the x-axis represents the molecular weight and the y-axis represents normalized dw/
dlogM as obtained by SEC.

significant decrease in the overall Ɖ of the diblock resulting in a final Ɖ
of 1.32 and 1.21, respectively. By further increasing the DP of the second
block to DP = 100 and DP = 200 even clearer shifts were observed by
SEC and the Ɖ of the diblock was reduced to 1.17 and 1.16, respectively.
Therefore, it can be concluded that a macroCTA of DP = 50 can be
satisfactorily chain-extended to yield diblocks with narrow molar mass
distributions upon the addition of a minimum DP of 50. A slightly
different profile was observed when a macroCTA of DP = 100 (Ɖ=1.58)
was employed. On this occasion, neither the addition of DP = 25 nor DP
= 50 could dramatically reduce the Ɖ (Ɖ=1.41 and Ɖ =1.32, respec­
tively). However, when the DP of the second block was increased to DP
= 100 and DP = 200, narrow molar mass distributions could be obtained
yielding diblocks with a Ɖ of 1.23 and 1.17 respectively. Upon repli­
cating the experiments utilizing a DP = 200 macroCTA (Ɖ=1.59), we
found that a diblock with Ɖ ~1.22 was only possible when 200 equiv­
alents of monomers were added. Instead, upon targeting DP = 25, DP =
50 and DP = 100 for the second block, only higher overall Ɖ diblock
copolymers could be prepared (Ɖ=1.49, Ɖ=1.40 and Ɖ=1.30). From
these experiments we can conclude the following:
(i) The targeted DP of the second block can significantly affect the
final Ɖ in diblock copolymers.
(ii) The higher the DP of the added block, the lower the Ɖ of the
diblock.
(iii) The higher the DP of the starting macroCTA, the more monomer
is required to be added to bring the overall Ɖ of the diblock down
to ~ 1.2. This suggests that the efficient protonation of the
macroCTA alone is not sufficient to control polymer Ɖ and that
the length of the added block should also be considered.
(iv) To target diblock copolymers with a wide range of Ɖ (i.e. a large
difference between the dispersity of the homopolymers and the
diblock copolymer), the length of the added block should be
equal or higher to the length of the macroCTA (i.e. DPadded block ≥
DPmacroCTA). To verify this was also the case for DP = 200, we did
a control experiment whereby 300 equivalents of monomer were
added during the in-situ chain extension and the overall Ɖ of the
diblock could be further decreased to 1.19 (Figure S16,
Table S22).
Last, but not least, we applied the acquired knowledge in designing
two triblock copolymers with alternating low and high Ɖ in both
aqueous and organic media (ACN). Specifically, by using the fully pro­
tonated RAFT agent, a homopolymer with a Ɖ of 1.17 (DP = 50) was first
obtained. Upon adding 75 equivalents of the next monomer and in the
presence of a base, we were able to increase the overall Ɖ of the diblock
to 1.53 (Fig. 6, Figure S17, Table S23). Once the diblock reached
quantitative monomer conversion, we added the next monomer together
with acid and brought the Ɖ of the triblock down to 1.19. Pleasingly,
very similar data could be attained in both solvent systems leading to
well-defined triblock copolymers with remarkable control over their Ɖ
(Fig. 6, Figure S17, Table S24).
