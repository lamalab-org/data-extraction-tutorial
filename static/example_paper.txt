Therefore, a structure−property study was performed to
ascertain the transfection efficiency of triblock micelles with an
ionic/hydrophilic shell containing ether (i) an anionic block
followed by a cationic block or vice versa (ii) a cationic block
followed by an anionic block. The core-forming hydrophobic
block was based on poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA), while the
anionic copolymer block consisted of 2-carboxyethyl acryl-
amide (CEAm) and hydrophilic NAM and the cationic block
contained 3-guanidinopropyl acrylamide (GPAm). The
combination of a pH-dependent anionic group with a pH-
independent cationic group represents a novel approach to
gene therapy, deviating from the conventional use of pH-
dependent cationic groups. The formed micelles and
micelleplexes were characterized regarding their physicochem-
ical and biological behavior, and it was clearly observed that
the anionic outer block provides advantages for their
application in gene delivery.
For the assembly of micelles, two sets of triblock copolymers
were synthesized by sequential reversible addition−fragmenta-
tion chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization (Figure 1A). For

the multiblock synthesis, the chain transfer agent (CTA)
(propanoic acid)yl butyl trithiocarbonate (PABTC) was used,
since it has optimal addition and fragmentation rates for the
polymerization of acrylates and acrylamides.36,37 The synthesis
of multiblock copolymers with controlled molar masses can be
challenging due to the accumulation of dead chains after each
consecutive chain extension, leading to high dispersity (Đ).38
This highlights the importance of maintaining a high
proportion of chains with the thiocarbonylthio group
throughout the polymerization. Since acrylates and acrylamides
possess high propagation rate coefficients, the initiator
concentration can be reduced while still achieving high
monomer conversions, and thus, the fraction of living chains
remains high.36,39 Furthermore, the azoinitiator V-65B was
chosen, since it generates radicals at an optimal rate at lower
temperatures (10 h half-time decomposition temperature of 51
°C in toluene).40 First, nBA was polymerized at 50 °C in 1,4-
dioxane to obtain P(nBA) as the first hydrophobic block (H)
and macroCTA (Figure 1A). For the first set of triblock
copolymers, P(nBA) was chain extended with tert-butyl-
protected CEAm (CEAmtB) and NAM as the anionic block
(A) obtaining P[(nBA)-b-(CEAmtB-co-NAM)], followed by a
chain extension with diBoc-protected GPAm (GPAmdiBoc) as
the cationic block (C), yielding P[(nBA)-b-(CEAmtB-co-
NAM)-b-(GPAmdiBoc)] (HACpro, protected variant). For the
second set of triblock copolymers, P(nBA) was first chain
extended with GPAmdiBoc, followed by a chain extension with
CEAmtB and NAM, obtaining P[(nBA)-b-(GPAmdiBoc)-b-
(CEAmtB-co-NAM)] (HCApro, protected variant). The two
sets each consisted of three triblock copolymers with a
comparable degree of polymerization (DP) of the hydrophobic
block (H, DP ≈80) and either (i) an anionic middle block
followed by a cationic outer block or (ii) a cationic middle
block followed by an anionic outer block (Table 1).
Preliminary experiments with block copolymers showed that
a molar amount of GPAm greater than 30 mol % and low
amounts of CEAm are needed to achieve high transfection
efficiencies, using NAM as a “stealth” moiety and for increased
colloidal stability.41 Therefore, the amount of cationic GPAm
(C) was varied between 30 and 37 mol %, while the amount of
anionic CEAm (A) ranged from 6 to 14 mol %, which is shown
in the bar chart of Figure 1B. Numbers after hyphen (HAC-g/c
and HCA-g/c) represent the mol % of GPAm (g) and the mol
% of CEAm (c).
P(nBA), the diblock and final protected triblock copolymers
were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to
determine the experimental number-average molar masses
(Mn,SEC) and Đ (Table 1 and Figure S8 and Table S6, SI).
Exemplary, the SEC traces of HACpro-30/9 (cationic outer
block), HCApro-31/9 (anionic outer block), and their
precursors are shown in Figure 2. P(nBA)78 revealing a narrow
molar mass distribution with Đ = 1.07, which shifted to higher
molar masses after chain extension, while maintaining their
monomodal and narrow character (Figure 2A). After the
second chain extension with GPAmdiBoc, the population shifted
to higher molar masses, revealing a tailing towards lower molar
masses. This might be due to dead polymer chains caused by
recombination throughout the block extensions and precursor
chains that failed to reinitiate, resulting in a broadened molar
mass distribution (Đ = 1.22).42 For the synthesis of HCApro-
31/9, the first chain extension with GPAmdiBoc led to a
broadened population with a slight tailing towards lower molar
masses (Đ = 1.24; Figure 2B). After the subsequent chain
extension with CEAmtB and NAM, the population shifted to
higher molar masses and a more narrow dispersity (Đ = 1.21).

average molar masses can be attributed to differences in
hydrodynamic volume from the PMMA standards. Further-
more, the kinetics of the copolymerization of CEAmtB and
NAM were investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy and SEC
(Figures S9−S11, SI), indicating a controlled copolymerization
process, which resulted in a slightly gradient structure due to
the more reactive NAM. Both triblock copolymers were
deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to expose the
guanidinium and carboxy group. The deprotection was
successful, since the peak of the Boc-/tert-butyl group at 1.5
ppm vanished, obtaining the final deprotected HAC-g/c and
HCA-g/c polymers (Figures S12−S14, SI).
The triblock copolymers were assembled into micelles using
the solvent exchange approach,12 where the polymers are first
dissolved in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran/methanol (THF/
MeOH 80/20 v/v%). Ultrapure water was added slowly,
followed by dialysis against 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH
5), generating micelles with a hydrophobic P(nBA) core and a
hydrophilic shell. Since the guanidinium group is fully charged
independent of the used pH-value (apparent pKa > 12),40 the
pH-responsive element at physiological pH is the anionic block
containing CEAm and NAM (apparent pKa(PCEAm) ≈
5.1).31 At a pH of 5, only about half of the carboxy groups
are charged, while at pH 7.4 almost all are charged (92%).
Therefore, initial attempts to formulate the triblock micelles at
physiological pH values failed and led to precipitation. At these
pH values, both polymer blocks are highly charged and interact
strongly, which might destabilize the triblock micelle solutions
at the given elevated concentrations.
Size investigations by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
revealed a similar Z-average value of hydrodynamic size for
all six triblock micelles under acidic conditions ranging from 25
to 36 nm (Figure 3). The triblock micelles with a cationic
outer block (HAC-34/6, -30/9, -34/14) showed monomodal
size distributions with narrow polydispersity indices (PDIs)
ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 (Figure 3, Figure S15, SI). In contrast,
the triblock micelles with an anionic outer block (HCA-37/6,
-31/9, -33/13) showed a bimodal intensity-weighted size
distribution with increased PDIs (0.25−0.34), which was most
prominent for HCA-33/13 (Figure S16, SI). Since cationic and
anionic moieties were combined within the shell of the triblock
micelles, an interpolyelectrolyte complex (IPEC) was expected
to be formed in the shell.43 Thus, the micelles with a cationic
outer block (HAC) formed more uniform micelles compared
to the HCA micelles, containing CEAm and NAM in the outer
shell.
With the different micelles at hand, we now investigated the
formation of micelleplexes using pDNA. In preliminary
experiments, N*/P ratios (molar ratios of protonatable
nitrogen atoms to phosphates of pDNA) of 20 and 3 μg
mL−1 pDNA were found to be optimal to achieve high
transfection efficiency and low toxicity. The complexation with
the genetic material resulted in micelleplexes with sizes
between 49 nm and 82 nm, which is still suitable for efficient
cellular uptake by endocytosis, but larger than the initial
micelles.44 The intensity-weighted size distributions were
monomodal for most of the micelleplexes with a maximum
PDI of 0.36 for HCA-33/13 (Figures S17 and S18, SI). The ζ-
potentials of all micelles/micelleplexes were above 20 mV
independent of the sequence, which can be attributed to the
excess of protonated amines due to the higher molar ratio of
cationic to anionic charges in the triblock micelles and the
excess of polymer micelles used for the formulation.
The cytotoxicity profiles of the polymer library were
investigated via the PrestoBlue assay. Based on ISO10993−5,
the mouse fibroblast cell line L929 was used. Figure 4A shows
a decrease in metabolic activity with an increasing polymer
concentration. The incorporation of stealth and anionic
functionalities showed a positive effect on the cytocompati-
bility of the micelles in comparison to the cationic
homopolymer poly(GPAm)71 (Gua 100), which served as
control. It should be noted that the cytocompatibility
improved with increasing mol % content of CEAm, whereas
the sequence had lower impact (HCA-33/13 vs HAC-34/14,
LC50 in Table S7).
At a physiological pH value, the guanidinium group is
positively charged and tends to interact with serum proteins.
Therefore, a serum-reduced medium D2H (Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 2% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-
yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer) was used for the
transfection assays. To assess the effect of the triblock
composition on gene delivery, additional transfection was
performed in D10H (10% FBS), which is closer to
physiological conditions. Due to the low serum concentration
in D2H, higher transfection efficiencies could generally be
achieved in comparison to D10H (Figure 4B: plot below,
dashed bars vs colored bars).
In the case of the more cytocompatible micelles with
increased content of CEAm (HCA-30/9 and HCA-33/13), the
HCA micelles demonstrated superior transfection efficiencies
in D2H in comparison to the HAC micelles. The order of the
blocks therefore was a decisive factor and an outer anionic
block appeared to be beneficial for improved transfection
efficiencies, while maintaining good cytocompatibility. For the
micelles with only 6 mol % CEAm (HAC-34/6 and HCA-37/
6) slightly higher transfection efficiencies were achieved for the
Figure 3. (A) Z-Average, (B) PDI, and (C) ζ-potential of the triblock
copolymer micelles and micelleplexes measured by DLS. Details can
be found in the Supporting Information (Figures S15−S18).

HAC micelles compared to its counterpart (HCA micelle) in
D2H. In this case, the CEAm content was probably too low to
result in performance differences for different block arrange-
ments.
The transfection efficiencies in D10H were similar for both
HAC-34/6 and HCA-37/6 and no significant differences in
efficiency were observed between D2H and D10H (Figure 4B:
plot above). Interestingly, HAC-34/14 and HCA-33/13
demonstrated the highest transfection efficiency in D10H
among all tested materials despite the highest anionic CEAm
content in the outer shell (HCA-33/13), which is usually
considered to reduce the efficacy of a system. This is in
contrast to common design principles using the cationic block
at the outside due to the enhanced accessability of cationic
charges for the genetic material. As this result was not
expected, the membrane interaction was investigated in more
detail, where commonly cationic groups play a crucial role.
These are presumably less present on the outside of HCA
micelles (e.g., HCA-33/13), but micelles are known to be a
dynamic system and interaction with the middle block cannot
be excluded. A modified hemolysis assay demonstrated an
alleviating hemolytic effect with increasing molar content of
anionic moiety (Figure S22A). This could be attributed to an
increasing charge compensation of the excess of cationic
groups, which reduced the interaction of the micelles with the
membrane at physiological conditions. If the pH value
decreases, as for example during endosomal uptake, the
carboxylic groups become protonated and the compensation
is diminished, which was also exemplified in an enhanced
erythrocyte aggregation rate at pH 6 compared to pH 7.4
(Figure S22). This effect was particularly prominent for
micelles with high anionic CEAm content (HAC-34/14 and
HCA-33/13). Overall, the best performer HCA-33/13
featured an optimal membrane interaction adapting to pH
changes and high cytocompatibility, which together yielded
high performances in transfection.
To study the uptake and endosomal release property of the
library, the membrane-impermeable dye calcein was used. The
Figure 4. (A) PrestoBlue assay was performed over 24 h using D10H in the L929 cell line. (B) Transfection efficiencies were investigated in D2H
(dashed bars) and D10H (colored bars) for 24 + 24 h in the HEK293T cell line at N*/P 20 using 3 μg mL−1 of EGFP expressing pDNA. Values
represent mean ± SD (n ≥3). Significances are illustrated as p* > 0.05, p** > 0.01, p*** > 0.001.
Figure 5. Endosomal release was analyzed via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) following simultaneous incubation with the non-
permeable dye calcein with a final concentration of 25 μg mL−1 (green) and micelleplexes with N*/P 20 with a pDNA concentration of 3 μg mL−1
on HEK293T cells over 6 h incubation in D10H and following incubation in D20 (6 + 2 h). The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342
(blue). Green dots indicate endocytotic uptake of calcein within cellular compartments, and the diffuse green fluorescence pattern indicates calcein
released to the cytosol. Non-treated and non-stained cells were used as the control.

endocytotic uptake of the particles leads to the concurrent
internalization of calcein (punctuate fluorescence pattern), and
the endosomal release leads to release of calcein (broad
cytosolic fluorescence pattern). In full growth medium
(D10H), all polymers revealed a fast uptake after 6 h
incubation in comparison to the non-complexed pDNA
(Figures S19−S20, SI). A broad cytosolic fluorescence pattern
of several cells could be observed by the micelleplexes with the
highest anionic CEAm content (HAC-34/14 and HCA-33/
13). A further 2 h incubation (total incubation time of 8 h, 6 +
2 h) led to increased endosomal release with the following
intensity pattern: HAC-34/14 > HCA-33/13 > HCA-31/9 and
HCA-37/6. The result revealed an improved endosomal
release by an increase of the CEAm content and underlined
the impact of the anionic CEAm block. However, the HAC
micelle showed more intensive calcein release in comparison to
the HCA composition (HAC 34/14 vs HCA-33/13), which
both outperform micelles with lower CEAm content or the
Gua 100 control (Figure 5).
